## Description

This application allows users to generate images from textual descriptions (prompts) using the Hugging Face API.  
It is built with Python and Streamlit, offering a simple and interactive interface for testing text-to-image generation

## Overview
This project implements a Text-to-Image generation app using the Hugging Face Inference API. Users can input a prompt (e.g., "a futuristic city at sunset") and receive a generated image using a pre-trained model.

The goal is to demonstrate how to connect a front-end interface built with Streamlit to a Hugging Face model and create a smooth and responsive user experience.

- **Marwa Haoudi**

## 1. Technologies Used

- Python 3.12
- Streamlit – Web app interface
- Hugging Face Inference API – Model hosting and inference
- Requests – HTTP requests to API
- dotenv – Secure handling of API tokens
- Pillow – Image processing and visualizatio
### 2. Clone the Project from GitHub

Make sure git is installed.  
In your terminal or Anaconda Prompt:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Marwahaoudi/project3-Text-To-Image.git
cd project3-Text-To-Image.git
```
### 3. Install Required Libraries
 ```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

```
### 4. Add Hugging Face API Token
Create a .env file with the following content:
 ```bash
HF_TOKEN=
```
### 5. Launch the app:
## Objectives
- Build an interactive front-end for text-to-image generation
- Learn to use Hugging Face's Inference API in production
- Handle asynchronous image generation and display in real time
- Develop an intuitive and accessible UI with Streamlit

## Architecture

 ```bash
User ➜ Streamlit Interface ➜ Hugging Face API ➜ Generated Image
```
- User enters a prompt.
- Streamlit sends the request with token to Hugging Face.
- The API returns the image.
- Streamlit displays the image.
## 🖼️ Example Outputs

| Prompt                        | Generated Image |
|------------------------------|-----------------|
| *"A cute cat wearing glasses reading a book"*   | ![Example 1](2.PNG) |
| *"a castle floating in space"* | ![Example 2](images/castle.png) |

> 💡 Tip: Create a folder named `images/` in your project directory and place sample output images there (e.g., `cat.png`, `castle.png`). This helps users visualize what the app can generate.
